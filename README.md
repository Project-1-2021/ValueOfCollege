# ValueOfCollege

## Project Proposal
It is traditionally thought that earning a 4 year degree is the best way to have a successful career.  While this may have been true historically, we believe that this may not be the best value within the IT career track.  We propose to analyze data to determine what the true value of a bachelor’s degree is versus getting specific certifications and/or technical school degrees.

## Project Description/Outline
Null Hypothesis:
Getting a 4 year degree in IT is the best value in Florida  
Alternate Hypothesis:
Getting a certificate/technical degree in IT is a better investment in Florida  


## Research questions to answer:
Scope: IT Field in Florida  
Is a 4 year degree a better investment vs a technical/certificate degree in Florida?  
What is the cost of a 4 year degree?  
What is the cost of a non-bachelor program?  
How are the jobs available distributed between bachelor degrees required vs not required?  
How are salary changes divergent or inline for certain periods of career?(first 10 years, next 10? etc)  
Is there any difference based on career type/level?  
How does long term salary growth vary between the two (Bachelor vs Certificate)?
