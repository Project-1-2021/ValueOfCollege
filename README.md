# ValueOfCollege

## Project Proposal
It is traditionally thought that earning a 4 year degree is the best way to have a successful career.  While this may have been true historically, we believe that this may not be the best value within the IT career track.  We propose to analyze data to determine what the true value of a bachelorâ€™s degree is versus getting specific certifications and/or technical school degrees.

## Project Description/Outline
Null Hypothesis:
Getting a 4 year degree in IT is the best value in Florida  
Alternate Hypothesis:
Getting a certificate/technical degree in IT is a better investment in Florida  



## What is the cost of tuition for each of the education levels?
The following graph shows the cost of each degree from a Florida school.  
Our data listed the cost per year and we assumed an Associate's degree requires 2 years and a Bachelor's degree requires 4.  
As expected the Bachelor's degree is more expensive overall.

## What is the average annual salary for all IT occupations?  
There is a wide variance across IT occupations with the median around $70k annualy.

This is the median of all median IT occupations.

## What is the average distribution for education requirments for all IT occupations?
Over 50% of the IT occupations have at least a bachelor's degree. However, there is a good amount of current position holders in the IT field with a Highschool diploma or less.

## What is the average return on each education level within the IT field?  
Due to limitations of our data we weren't able to report on this accurately so we made an assumption that lower education levels affected salary over time.  We weren't able to get salary data by education level.  We based this assumption on a graph from page 12 of [US Census Field of study documentation](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/assets/FieldOfStudyDataDocumentation.pdf).  

We defined ROI as salary over time less cost of education.
